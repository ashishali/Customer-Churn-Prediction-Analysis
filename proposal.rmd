## Research Question

* What factors most significantly predict customer churn in the telecom industry?
* Secondary questions:
  * How do service usage patterns and demographics correlate with churn probability?
  * Which specific services or contract features have the strongest protective effect against churn?
  * Can we identify high-risk customers early to implement targeted retention strategies?

## Cases

* Each case represents an individual customer of a telecommunications company
* The dataset contains 7,043 unique customers
* Each record includes comprehensive information about customer demographics, service subscriptions, billing information, and churn status

## Method of Data Collection

* The data was collected by the telecommunications company from their customer relationship management (CRM) system and billing databases
* It represents historical customer data from account creation through either current active status or account termination
* The information includes service subscriptions, billing details, demographic information, and geographic data

## Type of Study

* This is an observational study as it analyzes existing customer data without experimental manipulation
* The study examines patterns and relationships in historical data to identify predictive factors for customer churn

## Data Source

* Primary dataset: telecom_customer_churn.csv (7,043 rows Ã— 38 columns)
* Supplementary datasets: 
  * telecom_zipcode_population.csv - population data by zip code
  * telecom_data_dictionary.csv - metadata describing each variable

## Relevant Summary Statistics

Based on the preliminary analysis, the following summary statistics are relevant for understanding customer churn:

* Overall churn rate: Approximately 26.5% of customers have churned
* Demographic statistics:
  * Age distribution shows typical consumer age range (18-80 years)
  * Geographic distribution across multiple cities and zip codes
* Service adoption statistics:
  * Internet service types (Fiber Optic, DSL, None)
  * Additional service adoption rates (security, backup, streaming, etc.)
* Financial metrics:
  * Average monthly charges for churned vs. retained customers
  * Total charges and revenue differences between customer groups
* Contract and tenure statistics:
  * Contract type distribution shows higher churn for month-to-month contracts
  * Average tenure for churned customers is significantly lower (approximately 18 months vs. 38 months for non-churned)

## Statistical Methods

### Primary Analysis Method: Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is appropriate for this analysis because:

* The response variable (churn) is binary (Yes/No)
* We need to quantify the effect of multiple predictors on churn probability
* We want to obtain interpretable odds ratios for business decision-making
* It can handle both categorical and numerical predictors


```{r logistic-regression-example, eval=TRUE}
# Example of logistic regression model (simplified)
churn_model <- glm(
  churned ~ contract + internet_type + tenure_in_months + monthly_charge + 
           online_security + premium_tech_support,
  family = binomial(link = "logit"),
  data = telecom_churn
)

# Model summary
summary(churn_model)

# Example prediction
predicted_probs <- predict(churn_model, type = "response")
telecom_churn$predicted_churn_prob <- predicted_probs

# ROC curve assessment
roc_obj <- roc(telecom_churn$churned, predicted_probs)
auc_value <- auc(roc_obj)
cat("AUC:", auc_value)
```

### Secondary Analysis Methods

1. **Random Forest Classification**
   * Will help identify complex non-linear relationships and interactions
   * Provides feature importance to highlight the most predictive variables
   * Handles mixed data types effectively

```{r random-forest-example, eval=FALSE}
# Random Forest example (not evaluated to save computation time)
set.seed(123)
rf_model <- randomForest(
  churned ~ contract + internet_type + tenure_in_months + monthly_charge + 
            online_security + premium_tech_support + payment_method + age,
  data = telecom_churn,
  ntree = 100,
  importance = TRUE
)

# Variable importance
varImpPlot(rf_model)
```

2. **Survival Analysis**
   * Can analyze time-to-churn based on tenure
   * Provides insights into when customers are most at risk of churning
   * Allows for censored observations (current customers who haven't churned yet)

### Model Evaluation Strategy

The models will be evaluated using:

* Train/test split (70%/30%) for model validation
* Cross-validation to ensure model robustness
* ROC curves and AUC for classification performance
* Confusion matrix for precision, recall, and F1-score
* McFadden's RÂ² for logistic regression fit assessment

## Expected Outcomes

This analysis is expected to:

1. Identify the key predictors of customer churn in the telecom industry
2. Quantify the impact of each factor on churn probability
3. Develop a predictive model to identify at-risk customers before they churn
4. Provide actionable insights for reducing churn through targeted interventions
5. Generate recommendations for service improvements and retention strategies

The results will be valuable for:

* Marketing teams designing retention campaigns
* Product managers prioritizing service improvements
* Customer service teams implementing proactive retention measures
* Business leaders making strategic decisions about service offerings
